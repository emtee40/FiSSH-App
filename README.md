# FiSSH
SSH authentication via Fingerprint scanning over network (SSL Sockets).
This app stores your passphrase for the SSH key and when an authorized Fingerprint is scanned, it securely sends the passphrase via SSL Sockets to its desktop counterpart, which then completes the SSH login!

The binary is available on Google Play (at a minimal charge): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.iodev.fissh
If you don't have how to pay or just don't feel like paying, then you can always build your own binary, but you won't get automated updates.
