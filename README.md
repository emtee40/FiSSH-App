# FiSSH
SSH authentication via Fingerprint scanning over network (SSL Sockets).
This app stores your passphrase for the SSH key and when an authorized Fingerprint is scanned, it securely sends the passphrase via SSL Sockets to its desktop counterpart, which then completes the SSH login!

The binary is available on Google Play (FREE from now on!): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.iodev.fissh
